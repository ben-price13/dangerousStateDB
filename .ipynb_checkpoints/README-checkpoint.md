# Most Dangerous State Database Project

## Data Cleaning
The data in its Raw form is not ideal for the project.
A Python notebook utilizing the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries was used to clean the four .csv datasets.
Some RawData files were removed after cleaning to avoid conflicts with github's maximum file size of 100 MB.
However, a .pdf was saved to the CleanData directory which shows the results of the DataCleaning.ipynb notebook.
This .pdf details via Python comments the basic analysis and logic behind the removal or renaming of attributes.
The clean data was saved as .csv files in the CleanData directory.
